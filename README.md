# Deprecated

No longer maintaning or updating.

# CoffeePorter

All the CoffeeScript converters on Atom.io were either deprecated, non-existant, or singular features

You can do three types of conversion (the third only from the Packages menu):
- Convert the highlighted JS to Coffeescript
- Paste the JS in your clipboard into the current editor as Coffeescript
- Convert the whole file to Coffeescript, rename it with .coffee and delete the old one.

The first two assume you've highligted/copied valid JS! :)


Pull requests gladly accepted!!

TODO
- Get the specs to pass, lol
- Add error handling view when there are reasons something doesnt work
- maybe convert backto JS? Who would want that?
