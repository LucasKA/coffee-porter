# CoffeePorter

All the CoffeeScript converters on Atom.io were either deprecated or nonexistent.

While this is very much a first version, it will convert your JS to CS using the ever awesome js2coffee.

Pull requests gladly accepted.

TODO

- Write specs
- Add error handling message window
- Add ability to convert full on files
- maybe reverse convert, who knows?
